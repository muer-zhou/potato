# Assignment 19: Swapping Two Variables Using Pointers in C++

## Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of a **swap function** to exchange the values of two integer variables using pointers in C++. The code is modular, with separate header, implementation, and main files for better organization.

## Features
- Efficient swapping using pointers to avoid copying large data structures.
- Modular design with header and implementation files.
- Namespace `methods` to encapsulate the `swap` function.
