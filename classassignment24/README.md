# Assignment 24 - Customer Structure Program

## Description
This program defines a structure for representing customers in C++. Each customer has the following attributes:
- `ID`: A unique identifier for the customer (integer).
- `Name`: The full name of the customer (string).
- `Email`: The email address of the customer (string).

The program will ask the user to input the values for these attributes, store them in a `Customer` object, and then print the customer's details.

## Files
- `assignment24.cpp`: The main C++ file that contains the code for defining the customer structure and interacting with the user.
- `README.md`: This file provides a description of the project and instructions on how to run the program.

## How to Use
1. Compile the `assignment24.cpp` file using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++):
   ```bash
   g++ assignment24.cpp -o customerProgram
   ```

2. Run the compiled program:
   ```bash
   ./customerProgram
   ```

3. Follow the on-screen prompts to input the customer's ID, name, and email. The program will then display the customer's details.

## Example
```
Enter customer ID: 101
Enter customer name: John Doe
Enter customer email: john.doe@example.com

Customer Details:
ID: 101
Name: John Doe
Email: john.doe@example.com
```

## Requirements
- A C++ compiler like g++.
- Basic knowledge of how to run C++ programs.

## Class Information
- **Institution**: Berkeley City College
- **Class**: Computer Information Systems 25 (CIS 25)

## Notes
- Ensure that the `assignment24.cpp` file is present in the same directory where you compile the code.
- If you encounter any errors while compiling or running the program, verify that your environment is correctly set up for C++ development.
