# Assignment 26 - Point Structure with Operator Overloading

This project defines a `Point` structure with `x` and `y` coordinates and demonstrates operator overloading for equality (`==`) and stream insertion (`<<`).

## Files

- `assignment26.h` - Declares the `Point` structure and operator overloads.
- `assignment26.cpp` - Implements the operator overloads for `==` and `<<`.
- `main.cpp` - Main program to test the `Point` structure.

## Compilation and Execution

To compile and run the program:

```bash
g++ main.cpp assignment26.cpp -o assignment26
./assignment26
