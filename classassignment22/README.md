# Assignment 22: Extract First and Last Name from a Full Name

## Overview
This project demonstrates a program written in C++ to extract the **first name** and **last name** from a full name string provided by the user. The solution is designed to be modular, with separate files for the function declaration, implementation, and demonstration.

---

## Features
- **String Manipulation**: Extracts the first and last names using string streams.
- **Modular Design**: Functionality is split into a header file, implementation file, and main file for better organization.
- **Dynamic Input Handling**: Handles full names with multiple words or varying lengths using `getline`.
