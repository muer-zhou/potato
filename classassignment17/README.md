# Linear Search in C++

## Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of the **linear search algorithm** in C++ using a modular structure. The code is split into multiple files for better organization and maintainability:
- **Header file** for function declarations.
- **Implementation file** for function definitions.
- **Main file** to demonstrate usage.

## Features
- Modular design with separate files for header and implementation.
- Use of pointers and `const` to ensure efficient memory usage.
- Namespace `methods` to encapsulate the linear search function.

## Folder Structure
```
project_folder/
├── main.cpp                 # Contains the main function
├── methods/
│   ├── assignment17.cpp      # Function implementation
│   ├── assignment17.h        # Function declaration (header file)
├── README.md                # Documentation (this file)

## How to Compile and Run

### Prerequisites
- A C++ compiler (e.g., `g++`).
- Basic knowledge of working with a terminal or IDE.

### Steps
1. Clone or download the project to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal in the project directory.
3. Run the following command to compile the code:
   ```bash
   g++ -o main main.cpp methods/LinearSearch.cpp
   ```
4. Execute the program:
   ```bash
   ./main
   ```

## How It Works
### 1. **Linear Search Function**
The `linearSearch` function takes three parameters:
- A pointer to the integer array (`const int*`).
- The size of the array (`size_t`).
- The target value to search for (`int`).

It iterates through the array, checking each element. If the target is found, it returns the index; otherwise, it returns `-1`.

### 2. **Modular Structure**
- The **header file** (`assignment17.h`) declares the function in the `methods` namespace.
- The **implementation file** (`assignment17.cpp`) defines the function.
- The **main file** (`main.cpp`) uses the function and prints the results.

## Example Output
For an array `{10, 20, 30, 40, 50}` and target `30`:
```plaintext
Value found at index: 2
```

If the target is not found:
```plaintext
Value not found in the array.
```
